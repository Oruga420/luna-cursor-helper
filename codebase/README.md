- **Current Problem** (required): Description of the current problem
- **Bug File Path** (required): Path for bug file output
- **Solution File Path** (required): Path for solution file output

## Implementation Details

The implementation follows the specifications from the project objective and solution documents:

1. **User Interface**
   - Clean, modern design using Tailwind CSS
   - Responsive layout that works on all screen sizes
   - Intuitive form structure with clear labels

2. **Form Management**
   - React state management for form data
   - Dynamic file path handling with add/remove functionality
   - Comprehensive form validation

3. **Interaction Handling**
   - Loading states during API calls
   - Error handling and display
   - Popup system for showing generated prompts

4. **Accessibility**
   - Proper ARIA labels
   - Keyboard navigation support

## API Integration

The frontend is designed to work with a Flask backend. The form submission sends a POST request to `/api/process` with the following data structure:

```javascript
{
  request: string,
  filePaths: string[],
  currentProblem: string,
  bugFilePath: string,
  solutionFilePath: string
}
```
